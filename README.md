# Personality Type Prediction

The goal of the project is to create a tool for predicting personality type based on a user's digital activity using machine learning. 

## How to Run the Project
To run the project, please follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/michalbaldyga/personality-type-prediction-ops.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```shell
    cd <paste-your-project-directory>
    ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies. These are specified inside the project.

    ```shell
    pip install ...
    ```
4. Navigate to the project's frontend directory:
   
    ```shell
    cd frontend/src
    ```
5. Run the main script to start the application:
 
   ```shell
   python main.py
    ```

### Subfolders and Their Purposes

1. **archives**
   - Contains code that was developed during the project but ultimately not used for various reasons.

2. **backend**
   - Data collection, cleaning, processing, machine learning model training, evaluation, optimization, and prediction. This folder typically includes scripts, algorithms, and libraries essential for the data processing and analytical backbone of the project.

3. **frontend**
   - Contains the graphical user interface (GUI) components of the project.

4. **static**
   - Contains datasets and other static resources used in the project.
