# Preparing Data - Text

Script to clean up the dataset.

## Overview

Because the model used for transcription sometimes inserted the character we used as the delimiter `|` into the text, 
text cleaning had to be applied before loading the dataset for training.

## Usage

To run the training script, navigate to the directory containing `clean.py` and execute:

```bash
python clean.py
