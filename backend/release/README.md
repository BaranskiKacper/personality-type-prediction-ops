# Model Storage Directory

This directory is dedicated to storing the best-found models for the Personality Type Prediction project. Models are categorized based on the type of data they process: images and text.

## Directory Structure

The models are organized into two separate subdirectories:

- `img/`: Contains models trained for image-based personality type prediction.
- `text/`: Contains models trained for text-based personality type prediction.

## Accessing Models

Models within these directories have been saved after extensive training and validation. They represent the best-performing models in their respective categories (images and text).


### Image Models

Located under `personality-type-prediction-ops/backend/release/img/`, these models are specifically trained to analyze and predict personality types based on image data.

### Text Models

Located under `personality-type-prediction-ops/backend/release/text/`, these models are tailored for processing and predicting personality types based on textual data.

## Note

Our models have not been made public because we are not sure if our sources allow us to use their data for training.
